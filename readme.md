Datasets
========

Datasets are organized by languages. Currently, both English and French ones are available. They are generated by the programs in [lxa-py](https://github.com/lxa2015/lxa-py).
(Files over 100 MB and most JSON outputs are not up here to save space.)

For English, the raw corpus text is also available:

`english-brown.txt`: English Brown, 5.9 MB (a plain text of about 1 million word tokens and 50,000 word types)

_archives
---------

The `_archives` folder contains a few derived datasets of interest -- to be incorporated under the language folder.
